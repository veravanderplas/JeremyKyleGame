    Tracey. He&#39;s not taking the breakdown of their six-year relationship so well. Jemma is coming over to his home, collecting her belongings.<br>
</p>
<p class="question one">The doorbell rings. It's Jenna, the horrible bitch. What do you do?</p>

<p class="answer alreadydead wrong">> They're already dead</p>

<p class="question three"> Jenna starts screaming, like a fishwife, and refuses to pay<br>

    Being the daft cunt that she is, she refuses you again. Now what? </p>

<p class="answer shove wrong">You try to shove her outside</p>
<p class="answer giveup wrong">You give up, hand her the hamster</p>
