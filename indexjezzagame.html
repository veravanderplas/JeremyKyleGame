        Tracey. He&#39;s not taking the breakdown of their six-year relationship so well. This is Ryan's story<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="question Q1">The doorbell rings. It's Jenna, the horrible bitch. What do you do?</p>
    <p class="answer opendoor" onclick="picture()">
        <button id="explode">> You open the door and let her in</button>
    </p>
    <p class="answer nothome wrong">> You pretend you're not at home</p>
    <p class="answer daftcunt wrong">> You open the door and yell at her that she is a daft cunt</p>

    <p class="story paragraphOne"> As soon as you open the door and let Jenna in she starts talking. <br>
        You can't listen to her, because her disgusting freckles are distracting you. <br>
        She is talking about her hamsters, which are still at your place. </p>
    <p class="question Q2">She wants them back, are you going to give them to her?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="answer givehamster wrong">> Ofcourse, those little creatures have done nothing wrong</p>
    <p class="answer ransome">> Hell no, not unless that cunt pays a ransome for them.</p>
    <p class="answer alreadydead wrong">> They're already dead</p>

    <p class="story paragraphTwo">You tell Jenna that you will give the hamsters back, if she pays you €20 <br>
        Jenna starts screaming, like a fishwife, and refuses to pay<br>
        You can feel the anger rising in your throat. Once more, you ask her to pay up!</p>
    <p class="question Q3"> Being the daft cunt that she is, she refuses you again. Now what? </p>

    <p class="answer shove wrong">>You try to shove her outside</p>

        You will not be disrespected by this lightheaded bitch.<br>
        You look at Scott.<br>
        The hamster looks up, meeting your eyes and starts screaming.</p>
    <p class="question Q4">You take Scott out of the cage and....</p>

    <p class="story paragraphFour">With tremendous force you hurl the hamster against the nearest wall.<br>
        The hamster crashes into the wall, but somehow survives the impact.<br>
        Jenna starts wailing and looks at you with disgust. You don’t care anymore. <br>
        It’s all her own stupid fault. This is what she deserves for breaking up with you. Looking at her fills you with hatred.
        </p>
    <p class="question Q5">You walk towards Scott to...</p>

    <p class="story paragraphFive">You look at Jenna. "Look it's still alive!" <br>
        As you tell her this you stamp on Scott.<br>
        The hamster explodes beneath your boot with a satisfying crunch.<br>
        You realize that the crushed hamster made quite a mess on the floor.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="question Q6">How are you going to clean this mess?</p>
    <p class="answer mop wrong">>You get the mop and some bleach</p>
    <p class="answer dog">>You call your bulldog to eat the rodent remains off the flour</p>
    <p class="answer call wrong">> You call Jenna's mom and tell her she needs to come clean up the mess her daughter made </p>

    <p class="story paragraphSix">You whistle once, your bulldog Marshmellow comes running towards you.<br>

        "Good girl, Marshmellow!".<br>
        Jenna just looks at you in utter fear and seems to be unable to move. Good.<br>
        But there is still one more hamster to deal with....
    </p>
    <p class="question Q7">What should you do with the second hamster?</p>
    <p class="answer leave wrong">>You leave it be. Jenna knows now not to fuck with you</p>
    <p class="answer microwave">>You should put it in the microwave to see what happens</p>
    <p class="answer blender wrong">>You are going to put it in the blender for a nice smoothie</p>
